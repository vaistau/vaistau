        <p>today was chicago's first annual eco fest and first annual adopt and shop event! it's beautiful to see the city so revitalized after covid. i went to both, met two beautiful pups named glinda and merida, stopped at a local bakery and got the tastiest cheese strudel i've ever had, then stopped at an eastern imports gift shop and got some kind of ceramic pig with a tiny apple candle on its back + a red <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPhrTOg1RUk" rel="contrapoints video on envy" target="_blank">evil eye</a> bracelet, and then got home and submitted our adoption application at the rescue we spoke with at the adopt and shop event. life is good :)</p>
