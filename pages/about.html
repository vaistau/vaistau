        <p>I'm a <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/" rel="the odin project" target="_blank">DIY</a> front-end
            developer whose formal education consisted entirely of medical science. Suffice it to say, I may not recall
            the more intricate complexities of computer science, but I'm quite good at looking them up. Here are the <a
                href="https://github.com/vaistau" rel="github" target="_blank">projects</a> I've worked on, and here are
            the <a href="resume.html" rel="resume">tools/skills</a> I've picked up along the way. I aspire to find my
            niche
            as some form of creative technologist â€” computers are pointless if not used to create emotionally
            compelling and beautiful things.</p>
        <p>I like dogs, horror movies, <a

                rel="goodreads" target="_blank">books</a>, going on night walks, and exploring the weird, decentralized
            regions of the internet (more on that below, as well as on the <a href="wiki/bookmarks.html"

        <h2 class="title">Inspect Site</h2>
        <p>I first started working on this site on 05/26/2022 after lurking and reaping inspiration from Olia Lialina
            and Dragan Espenschied's archive of <a href="https://blog.geocities.institute/"
                rel="one terabyte of kilobyte age" target="_blank">Geocities</a>, as well as Kyle Drake's revival of the
            framework on <a href="https://neocities.org/browse" rel="neocities" target="_blank">Neocities</a>, on which
            this site is hosted.</p>
        <p>In accordance to the old-school structures of the aforementioned sites, this website is (for now) composed
            entirely of HTML, CSS, and a sprinkle of JavaScript. Its minimal design is intentional. My first
            experience learning HTML was in middle school when I began to tinker with themes on Tumblr. I've learned
            much since then and will continue to learn more. With that said, I want this to be a forever WIP project
            that grows and changes with me as I expand my skill set. In other words, <a
                href="https://justinjackson.ca/webmaster/" rel="webmaster manifesto" target="_blank">I'm a fucking
                webmaster</a>.</p>
