        <p>This is my low effort micro blog. The idea is inspired by imageboards and Twitter, except only I can post
            and I don't have to eat the algorithm.</p>

                <p>this is my first time making a personal site from scratch yaaaaaay. I think I'm gonna leave it at this for now but I can tell it's gonna be under construction forever. the color scheme is already starting to annoy me lmao</p><p>as for this micro blog, it's a total WIP bc some of my ideas for it are a tad ambitious -- it will be hardcoded in HTML for the time being but that's ok. when the time/desire comes I will make the posting process more dynamic w javascript. I had considered creating a mastodon account and embedding my feed onto this page but decided against it bc one of the reasons I wanted to create this in the first place was to escape the likes/comments/general parasocial-ness that comes with social media, centralized or not. I just want a digital space to word vom and post dumb pictures I find on imageboards.</p><p>oh also I need to add a pagination function but I'll put that off until there's enough posts to warrant it</p>
