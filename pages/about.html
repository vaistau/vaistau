        <p>I'm a <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/" rel="the odin project" target="_blank">DIY</a> front-end
            developer whose formal education consisted entirely of medical science. Suffice it to say, I may not recall
            the more intricate complexities of computer science, but I'm quite good at looking them up. Here are the <a
                href="https://github.com/vaistau" rel="github" target="_blank">projects</a> I've worked on, and here are
            the <a href="resume.html" rel="resume">tools/skills</a> I've picked up along the way. I aspire to find my
            niche
            as some form of creative technologist and create websites that are intentional and playful â€” computers are pointless if not used to create emotionally
            compelling and beautiful things.</p>
        <p>I like dogs, horror <a href="https://letterboxd.com/olderhag/" rel="letterboxd" target="_blank">movies</a>, decaf coffee, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/77402014-vaiva"
                rel="goodreads" target="_blank">books</a>, going on night walks, <a
                href="https://open.spotify.com/user/ms7k3k2e4jpiy1yyjw3i1exx8?si=4d3aeea7b49c427e" rel="spotify"
                target="_blank">music</a>, and exploring the weird, decentralized
            regions of the internet (more on that below, as well as in my <a href="https://www.are.na/vaiva-s"
                rel="are.na" target="_blank">digital garden</a>).</p>

        <h2 class="title">Inspect Site</h2>
        <p>I first started working on this site on May 26, 2022 after lurking and reaping inspiration from Olia Lialina
            and Dragan Espenschied's archive of <a href="https://blog.geocities.institute/"
                rel="one terabyte of kilobyte age" target="_blank">Geocities</a>, as well as Kyle Drake's revival of the
            framework on <a href="https://neocities.org/browse" rel="neocities" target="_blank">Neocities</a>.</p>
        <p>In accordance to the old-school structures of the aforementioned sites, this website is (for now) composed
            entirely of HTML and CSS. Its minimal design is intentional. My first
            experience learning HTML was in middle school when I began to tinker with themes on Tumblr. I've learned
            much since then and will continue to learn more. With that said, I want this to be a forever WIP project
            that grows and changes with me as I expand my skill set. In other words, <a
                href="https://justinjackson.ca/webmaster/" rel="webmaster manifesto" target="_blank">I'm a fucking
                webmaster</a>.</p>
